Lessons is a file of all the subtopics, and where it can be found in a levelled text book, the world of maths textbook or the 3-10a textbook. Sometimes a subtopic is repeated because it can be part of more than one level. For example it could be "extending" for one level, "at level" for the next level and then "consolidating" for the next level after that.

World lessons are all the world text book. Perhaps this is now unneccessary with the "Lessons" file. However, there are a few subtopics in the world of maths that is not in a level text.
